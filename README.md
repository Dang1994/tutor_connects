**Author:** Subrat Kumar [My Website](https://sites.google.com/view/subratdang/home)

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a **Tutor Finder Bot** designed to address the challenges of finding and evaluating tutors in rural areas, such as Western Odisha. The bot streamlines the process of connecting families with qualified tutors by leveraging a **React Native front end** and a **RASA back end**. It provides an easy-to-use mobile interface for families to search for tutors, evaluate their profiles, and communicate directly. In the feature, the system will also incorporate an **LLM-based reasoning engine** to recommend tutors based on specific criteria, ensuring transparency and improving the overall effectiveness of the education system.

## Key Features
- **User-Friendly Mobile Interface**: Built with React Native for seamless accessibility on mobile devices.
- **Intelligent Tutor Recommendations**: Uses a large language model (LLM) to provide reasoning-based recommendations for tutors.
- **Biodata Submission**: Tutors can easily submit their biodata and credentials through the bot.
- **Feedback System**: Families can provide feedback on tutors, enabling continuous improvement and performance evaluation.
- **Transparent Communication**: Facilitates direct communication between families and tutors through the bot.
- **Standardized Payment Mode**: Promotes fair and transparent payment structures based on tutor performance.

## Technologies Used
- **React Native**: For building the cross-platform mobile front end.
- **RASA**: For the conversational AI back end, enabling natural language interactions.
- **Large Language Model (LLM)**: For intelligent reasoning and tutor recommendations. #TODO
- **Mobile Development**: Ensures accessibility and ease of use for families and tutors in rural areas.
